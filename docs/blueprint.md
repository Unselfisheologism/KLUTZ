# **App Name**: MediScan AI

## Core Features:

- Secure Image Upload: Securely upload medical images (X-rays, MRI, CT scans) to the application using Puter.js's cloud storage.

- Image Preprocessing: Optimize the image preprocessing, ensuring high performance using resizing and compression techniques, to make the images suitable for processing in GPT-4o.
- Medical Report Generation: The AI generates structured medical reports which contains findings, possible differential diagnoses and relevant recommendations. It functions as a reasoning tool that chooses the most relevant information about the images being processed.
- Insight Display: Display AI-generated insights with actionable next steps and insights about possible patient treatments or other medical advice.
- User Authentication: Use Puter.jsâ€™s authentication flows to ensure that only authorized users can view protected content and perform protected actions.
